// GeneralsX @build Android port 06/07/2026, reworked 07/07/2026
// Thin shell over SDL3's SDLActivity. Responsibilities:
//  1. Name the native libraries to load (libmain.so = the game).
//  2. On launch, extract the small bundled runtime files (fonts/, dxvk.conf,
//     DefaultOptions.ini) from APK assets into the external files dir, which
//     SDL3Main.cpp makes the game's working directory. Game .big archives are
//     NOT bundled — the user picks their own via the GeneralsZH Setup app.
//  3. If no valid game folder is configured yet (checked via SetupActivity's
//     saved preference, mirroring the marker file SDL3Main.cpp reads),
//     redirect to Setup INSTEAD OF calling super.onCreate() — this means
//     libmain.so is never dlopen'd on a misconfigured install, so a missing
//     game data folder can never look like (or mask) a native crash.

    // and centered vertically on each edge, meant to protect an in-app
    // camera-pan-recovery swipe from being stolen by the OS back gesture.
    // The math assumed a tall portrait surface; this app is
    // a landscape-only orientation (AndroidManifest.xml), so
    // mSurface.getHeight() is the SHORT dimension -- on a typical 20:9
    // landscape phone that's ~360dp, giving only ~80dp of open margin on
    // each side (out of a "200dp centered" band that assumed hundreds of
    // dp more room than actually existed), not the few hundred dp intended.
    // Combined with AOSP's own bottom-gesture-height inset eating most of
    // the lower margin, the actually-usable open region shrank to a sliver
    // -- exactly the "works in some tiny millimeter" the tester reported.
    // Removed entirely rather than re-tuned: the touch-classification
    // state machine in SDL3GameEngine.cpp (PENDING -> PANNING dead-zone
    // logic) has been substantially rewritten since the original camera-
    // pinned-at-edge bug this was protecting against, so it's not
    // confirmed that bug still reproduces the same way -- removing this
