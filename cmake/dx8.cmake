# Apply the Android patch set idempotently (skip when the
# working tree already carries a patch, fail the configure when apply
# fails, so an unpatched DXVK can never ship silently):
#  - dxvk-android.patch: unversioned .so names (APK/jniLibs cannot carry the
#    versioned-name + symlink layout meson emits for desktop Unix)
#  - dxvk-sdl3-pixel-size.patch: use drawable pixels on high-density Android
#    displays rather than logical window coordinates.
#  - dxvk-vulkan11-adaptive.patch: lowers the hard Vulkan floor from 1.3 to
#    1.1, falling back to the pre-1.3 KHR/EXT extensions on adapters that
#    only report Vulkan 1.1/1.2 (Mali, Unisoc, PowerVR) while leaving >=1.3
#    adapters (including Adreno via Turnip driver injection) unaffected —
#    see issue #5 ("DxvkAdapter: Failed to create device" on Unisoc)
#  - dxvk-resource-refcount-memory-order.patch: DxvkResourceAllocation's
#    incRef/decRef used memory_order_acquire on both, with no release —
#    a no-op on x86 (DXVK's dev/test target, where every RMW is already a
#    full fence) but on ARM's weaker model it lets a thread recycle an
#    allocation before another thread's just-prior writes to it are
#    visible. Matches the exact corruption real devices reported
#    ("DxvkResourceAllocationPool: corrupted free list head") — see
#    issues #2, #9, #11.
#  - dxvk-mali-clip-distance.patch: the D3D9 backend requested
#    shaderClipDistance/shaderCullDistance unconditionally and the DXSO
#    compiler declared SPIR-V's ClipDistance capability on every vertex
#    shader regardless of device support — true on desktop/Adreno, false
#    on Mali G57, confirmed via Vulkan validation layers as the exact
#    VUID-VkShaderModuleCreateInfo-pCode-08740 error preceding the
#    libGLES_mali.so SIGSEGV on issue #9's device. Now gated on whether
#    the device actually reports the feature.
#  - dxvk-mali-g76-robustness2-optional.patch: VK_EXT_robustness2 was
#    hard DxvkExtMode::Required — fine on desktop/Adreno, but Mali-G76
#    (Redmi Note 8 Pro) reports Vulkan 1.1 with no robustness2 at all,
#    so vkCreateDevice refused outright ("required extension(s) missing").
#    The two features this fork leans on already survive without it on
#    macOS (MoltenVK doesn't support it either), and everything else that
#    reads them already treats them as optional. Now Optional, same as
#    every other extension this project doesn't unconditionally require.
# dxvk-android-missing-fallback-extensions.patch: the sub-1.2/1.3 KHR/EXT
# fallback extensions (timelineSemaphore, vulkanMemoryModel, dynamicRendering,
# maintenance4, synchronization2, hostQueryReset) were declared and queried
# but never registered in DxvkAdapter::getExtensionList(), so vkCreateDevice
# never actually enabled them despite the feature bits being reported as
# supported -- root cause of the Mali-G76 (Redmi Note 8 Pro) timeline
# semaphore VUID crash found after the robustness2-optional fix.
# dxvk-mali-g76-legacy-barrier-fallback.patch: root cause of the Mali-G76
# SIGSEGV, confirmed via a real Android tombstone (root access): the driver
# has no VK_KHR_synchronization2 at all (apiVersion 1.1, extension absent),
# so vkCmdPipelineBarrier2/vkCmdSetEvent2/vkQueueSubmit2 (and their KHR
# aliases) all resolved to nullptr, and DxvkBarrierBatch::flush's
# unconditional call crashed with a null-pointer-call SIGSEGV on the
# dxvk-cs thread -- not a bug in DxvkBarrierTracker (that address was a
# bystander symbol from our own crash handler's PC==0 blind spot, since
# fixed separately in AndroidCrashHandler.cpp). This adds a legacy
# vkCmdPipelineBarrier/vkCmdSetEvent/vkQueueSubmit fallback (with a
# VkPipelineStageFlags2/VkAccessFlags2 -> legacy 32-bit conversion) for
# when synchronization2 isn't available, the same thing every
# mobile-shipping game engine (including this exact device's copy of Call
# of Duty Mobile) already does instead of depending on it.
# dxvk-mali-g76-semaphore-fn-fallback.patch: same class of bug as the
# barrier fallback, one layer down -- vkResetQueryPool/vkGetSemaphore-
# CounterValue/vkSignalSemaphore/vkWaitSemaphores are promoted-in-1.2 core
# functions with no KHR/EXT fallback, so they resolved to nullptr on this
# 1.1-only device too. Found via a real Android tombstone after the
# barrier fix got device init past its previous crash point:
# DxvkSubmissionQueue::finishCmdLists's vkWaitSemaphores call, null-pointer
# SIGSEGV on the dxvk-queue thread.
# dxvk-mali-g76-4444-format.patch: D3DFMT_A4R4G4B4/X4R4G4B4 mapped to
# VK_FORMAT_A4R4G4B4_UNORM_PACK16, core-only since Vulkan 1.3. Registering
# VK_EXT_4444_formats (its sub-1.3 backport) wasn't enough on Mali-G76 --
# the driver still reports the format unusable for actual image creation
# even with the extension enabled, so CreateTexture kept silently failing
# (tombstone-confirmed SIGSEGV in WaterRenderObjClass::init, which locks a
# surface DXVK never created). Remapped to the same universally-supported
# 8-bit BGRA format already used for A8R8G8B8/X8R8G8B8 instead -- used
# pervasively (fonts, radar, shroud, thumbnails, water's white
# placeholder), none of which notice the extra memory.
# dxvk-mali-g76-copy-commands2.patch: VK_KHR_copy_commands2 (needed for
# vkCmdCopyBufferToImage2/vkCmdCopyImage2/vkCmdBlitImage2/etc., all
# already wired with a KHR fallback in vulkan_loader.h) was never
# registered in getExtensionList, same missing-registration bug as the
# earlier six-extension fix, just found one crash later: SIGSEGV in
# DxvkContext::copyImageBufferData on Mali-G76, confirmed via tombstone.
# dxvk-mali-g76-legacy-copy-fallback.patch: registering VK_KHR_copy_commands2
# wasn't enough -- Mali-G76 genuinely doesn't support it (unlike the
# earlier six-extension registration bug), so vkCmdCopyBufferToImage2 and
# its five siblings (vkCmdCopyBuffer2, vkCmdCopyImage2, vkCmdCopyImage-
# ToBuffer2, vkCmdBlitImage2, vkCmdResolveImage2) all stayed null.
# SIGSEGV persisted identically in DxvkContext::copyImageBufferData after
# the extension-registration fix, confirmed via a second tombstone at the
# exact same offsets. Adds a legacy (non-"2") fallback for all six,
# gated on the resolved function pointer itself rather than a cached
# feature bool (DxvkDevice is only forward-declared in this header).
# dxvk-mali-g76-legacy-render-pass.patch: Mali-G76 also genuinely lacks
# VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering, which DXVK 2.x's whole render-target-binding
# and (monolithic) pipeline-creation path is unconditionally built on --
# SIGSEGV (null vkCmdBeginRendering) on the very first draw call,
# confirmed via tombstone in DxvkContext::renderPassBindFramebuffer. No
# 1:1 legacy function exists for dynamic rendering, so this adds a
# minimal classic VkRenderPass/VkFramebuffer object cache back
# (dxvk_legacy_renderpass.h/.cpp, new files) used only when
# !features().vk13.dynamicRendering: DxvkContext::renderPassBindFramebuffer
# /renderPassUnbindFramebuffer branch to vkCmdBeginRenderPass/
# vkCmdEndRenderPass, and DxvkGraphicsPipeline::createOptimizedPipeline
# uses a format/sample-count-compatible render pass instead of chaining
# VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfo (graphics-pipeline-library's own
# createBasePipeline path was already gated on device support and needs
# no change).
# dxvk-mali-g76-composite-alpha.patch: swap chain creation hardcoded
# VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR. Real-device testing (Redmi Note 8
# Pro / Mali-G76 MC4) found a surface that only reports
# VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_INHERIT_BIT_KHR as supported (validation:
# VUID-VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR-compositeAlpha-01280), so
# vkCreateSwapchainKHR failed and left the swapchain null, crashing the
# next time the render loop touched it. Now picks OPAQUE when supported,
# otherwise the first bit the surface actually reports.
# dxvk-mali-g76-vertex-buffer-stride-fallback.patch: vkCmdBindVertexBuffers2
# (Vulkan 1.3 core / VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state) was called
# unconditionally in DxvkContext::updateVertexBufferBindings, null on
# Mali-G76 (Vulkan 1.1 only) -- tombstone-confirmed SIGSEGV on the very
# first indexed draw call. Legacy vkCmdBindVertexBuffers has no per-draw
# stride parameter, so updateVertexBufferBindings also now only selects
# dynamic per-draw strides when the "2" function is actually available;
# otherwise the real stride is baked into the pipeline's
# VkVertexInputBindingDescription as usual, avoiding a stride-0 fallback
# (silent broken rendering) once the crash itself is fixed.
# dxvk-mali-g76-extended-dynamic-state.patch: after the fixes above got
# the game rendering, validation on Mali-G76 revealed
# vkCreateGraphicsPipelines() unconditionally using
# VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_CULL_MODE/FRONT_FACE/VIEWPORT_WITH_COUNT/etc.
# (VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state) and vkCreateShaderModule() declaring
# SPV_EXT_demote_to_helper_invocation (D3D9 alpha-test emulation),
# neither ever registered on this fork -- same missing-registration bug
# as khrCopyCommands2, just found via VUIDs instead of a crash this
# time (the driver appears to tolerate the malformed pipeline/shader
# module well enough to not immediately SIGSEGV, but it's undefined
# behavior per spec). Also found and fixed a second, unrelated gap
# while investigating: D3D9's *fixed-function* vertex shader compiler
# (d3d9_fixed_function.cpp) unconditionally declared SPIR-V's
# ClipDistance capability too -- a separate compiler from the DXSO one
# that dxvk-mali-clip-distance.patch already gated, so it was missed by
# that earlier fix.
# dxvk-mali-g76-dynamic-state-fallback.patch: registering
# VK_EXT_extended_dynamic_state (dxvk-mali-g76-extended-dynamic-state.patch)
# wasn't enough -- Mali-G76 genuinely doesn't support it (unlike the
# earlier six-extension registration bug), confirmed by a real tombstone:
# SIGSEGV inside the Mali driver itself, called from
# DxvkGraphicsPipeline::createOptimizedPipeline. Unlike previous legacy-
# function-pointer fallbacks, there is no dynamic per-draw equivalent for
# VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_CULL_MODE/FRONT_FACE at all, so this drops them from
# the pipeline's dynamic state entirely and bakes a fixed
# VK_CULL_MODE_NONE (this is a "step 1" cheap fix: crash gone, but no
# per-draw cull mode support on this device until/unless a bigger
# follow-up threads real cull state through the pipeline cache key).
# VK_DYNAMIC_STATE_VIEWPORT_WITH_COUNT/SCISSOR_WITH_COUNT do have a
# legacy equivalent (core 1.0 VIEWPORT/SCISSOR, fixed count baked in --
# harmless since D3D9 never uses more than one viewport), so those fall
# back properly instead of being dropped.
# dxvk-mali-g76-demote-to-helper-fallback.patch: VK_EXT_shader_demote_
# to_helper_invocation is ALSO genuinely unsupported on Mali-G76 (used
# by D3D9's alpha-test and texkill/clip instruction emulation) -- unlike
# extended_dynamic_state this produced a hard failure, not just a
# validation warning: vkCreateShaderModule returned
# VK_ERROR_INITIALIZATION_FAILED outright, and DXVK didn't handle the
# resulting null shader module gracefully in
# DxvkGraphicsPipeline::createOptimizedPipeline. Adds SpirvModule::
# opKill() (didn't exist anywhere in this codebase -- every discard-like
# operation went through demote-to-helper) as a fallback: a plain SPIR-V
# discard instead of demoting the invocation. Slightly less accurate
# (no derivatives survive past the discard, so texkill'd pixels can
# pick a slightly wrong mip level for subsequent texture samples in the
# same shader), but a fixed, acceptable tradeoff against not being able
# to compile the shader at all. Alpha test is unaffected by this
# tradeoff since it's always the last operation in the pixel shader.
# dxvk-mali-g76-null-descriptor-fallback.patch: VK_EXT_robustness2's
# nullDescriptor sub-feature is also genuinely unsupported on Mali-G76
# (already correctly disabled at the device level by
# dxvk-mali-g76-robustness2-optional.patch), but the descriptor-set-
# update code in DxvkContext still unconditionally wrote VK_NULL_HANDLE
# for unbound sampled/storage/combined-image-sampler and uniform/storage
# buffer slots, which is only a valid VkImageView/VkBuffer value when
# nullDescriptor IS supported. Confirmed via engine log VUIDs
# (VUID-VkWriteDescriptorSet-descriptorType-02997,
# VUID-VkDescriptorBufferInfo-buffer-02998) right before a crash inside
# the Mali driver itself. Adds a dummy 1x1 image (plus per-view-type
# DxvkImageView cache, covering 1D/2D/3D/Cube/array variants) to
# DxvkUnboundResources, mirroring its existing dummy buffer/sampler
# pattern, and uses it (plus the existing dummy buffer) instead of
# VK_NULL_HANDLE when nullDescriptor is unavailable.
# dxvk-mali-g76-swapchain-blitter-legacy-renderpass.patch:
# DxvkSwapchainBlitter::present() (the final swapchain present/blit,
# HUD and cursor compositing) is a separate consumer of dynamic
# rendering that doesn't go through DxvkContext::renderPassBind
# Framebuffer at all, so it was missed by dxvk-mali-g76-legacy-
# render-pass.patch above. Confirmed via a real tombstone: SIGSEGV at
# pc=0x0 (null function pointer call, vkCmdBeginRendering) on the CS
# thread inside DxvkSwapchainBlitter::present, reached only once the
# main render path (already using the legacy render pass pool) starts
# succeeding far enough to present a frame. Routes present() through
# the same DxvkLegacyRenderPassPool via a single-color-attachment
# DxvkRenderTargets/DxvkRenderPassOps built from the same layout/
# loadOp values already computed for the dynamic-rendering path, so
# the two branches stay in sync.
# dxvk-mali-g76-blitter-pipeline-legacy-renderpass.patch: the previous
# patch got present() past its own vkCmdBeginRendering/vkCmdEndRendering
# calls, but performDraw() inside that same present() call still
# crashed one level deeper -- DxvkSwapchainBlitter::createPipeline()
# (and the sibling createCursorPipeline()/HudRenderer::createPipeline(),
# same pattern) build their VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo independently
# of DxvkGraphicsPipeline's own cache, chaining
# VkPipelineRenderingCreateInfo unconditionally and leaving .renderPass
# at VK_NULL_HANDLE (only valid under dynamic rendering). Confirmed via
# a real tombstone: SIGSEGV inside the Mali driver's
# vkCreateGraphicsPipelines, called from DxvkSwapchainBlitter::
# createPipeline via performDraw via present. All three now chain a
# real getCompatibleRenderPass() handle instead when the device lacks
# dynamic rendering, same as the main pipeline path. Note: this patch
# file was later extended (same crash site, dynamic-state fix) -- see
# its own header comment for the full history.
# dxvk-mali-g76-blitter-null-descriptor-fallback.patch: one more
# independent consumer of the nullDescriptor gap
# (dxvk-mali-g76-null-descriptor-fallback.patch above only covered
# DxvkContext's own descriptor update loop). DxvkSwapchainBlitter::
# performDraw() writes its gamma/HUD/cursor descriptors unconditionally
# (all 4 bindings are statically referenced by the present shader via
# spec constants), leaving imageView at VK_NULL_HANDLE whenever that
# frame has no gamma ramp/HUD/cursor to composite -- confirmed via a
# real tombstone at the exact same Mali driver call site as the
# earlier nullDescriptor fix. Adds a small DxvkDevice::dummyResources()
# forwarding accessor (the blitter isn't a DxvkContext, so it can't
# reach DxvkObjects's dummy resources via the usual m_common friend
# access) and uses the existing dummy-image-view cache through it.
# dxvk-mali-g76-format-properties3-fallback.patch: root cause of the
# green/magenta texture corruption. DxvkAdapter::getFormatFeatures read
# its results out of a VkFormatProperties3 chained into
# vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties2, but that struct is core only in
# Vulkan 1.3 and otherwise needs VK_KHR_format_feature_flags2 -- which
# this build never enables anywhere. A Vulkan 1.1 driver silently ignores
# the unrecognised pNext node and never writes to it, so the
# zero-initialised struct came back untouched and EVERY format reported
# ZERO features. Completely invisible: no VUID, no DXVK error, and the
# engine's own "no valid texture format" assert is compiled out in
# release. Downstream that made IDirect3D9::CheckDeviceFormat answer
# D3DERR_NOTAVAILABLE for every format, so DX8Caps marked even DXTC
# unsupported, Get_Valid_Texture_Format fell off the end of its fallback
# ladder and degraded every texture in the game to R5G6B5, and the
# CompatLib D3DX shims then bailed out on the resulting format mismatch
# without writing any texels -- leaving uninitialised VRAM (the flat
# green) or the engine's own magenta "missing texture" placeholder.
# Fixes it by reading the core VkFormatProperties2::formatProperties
# when VkFormatProperties3 is unavailable; VkFormatFeatureFlagBits2
# deliberately shares bit values with VkFormatFeatureFlagBits, so the
# widening is exact.
# dxvk-mali-g76-hud-image-legacy-renderpass.patch: DxvkSwapchainBlitter::
# renderHudImage is a third consumer of dynamic rendering in that file,
# separate from present() and from the pipeline creation paths, and it was
# missed when those were converted. It only runs when the DXVK HUD is
# enabled AND the swap chain needs composition, which is why it stayed
# hidden until the HUD was turned on to collect frame timings -- then it
# crashed immediately on a null vkCmdBeginRendering (tombstone: pc=0x0 in
# renderHudImage). Routes it through the same DxvkLegacyRenderPassPool.
# Unlike present(), this pass uses LOAD_OP_CLEAR, so it always supplies a
# clear value.
# dxvk-mali-g76-hud-stderr-log.patch: mirrors the same fps/drawcalls/
# submissions/pipelines values the on-screen DXVK_HUD overlay already
# computes into stderr (one throttled line per item, same ~0.5s cadence
# as the overlay refresh), so real numbers can be read straight out of
# generalszhlogNN.txt instead of relying on a screenshot of the overlay.
# HudPipelineStatsItem had no built-in throttle of its own (it recomputes
# every frame), so it gets its own timer purely for the log line.
# dxvk-refcount-memory-order-audit.patch: a real device report (Adreno
# 830, main-menu background video playing -- i.e. very frequent
# texture/surface lock-unlock churn) still showed
# DxvkResourceAllocationPool corruption after dxvk-resource-refcount-
# memory-order.patch above, which fixed exactly this signature for
# DxvkResourceAllocation specifically. Auditing every other atomic
# refcounted class in this fork for the same acquire-only (or, for
# DxvkSampler, fully relaxed) decrement pattern found the identical gap
# in DxvkGpuEvent, DxvkGpuQuery/DxvkQuery, DxvkLatencyTracker, DxvkSampler
# and DxvkPagedResource (dxvk_sparse.h's acquire()/release(), which
# DxvkPagedResource::incRef/decRef just forward to). Same fix as before:
# relaxed increment, release decrement, and an explicit acquire fence on
# the thread that actually observes the count reach zero, before it
# destroys/recycles the object -- the standard Boost.SmartPtr/libstdc++
# shared_ptr idiom. This closes every other instance of the same class of
# bug found so far, but is a mitigation applied by code audit, not a
# confirmed fix for this specific tombstone -- no access to the reporting
# device to verify live.
# dxvk-android-disable-resource-allocation-recycling.patch: diagnostic
# Android-only bypass for the pool whose embedded free list is still seen
# corrupted on device. Uses ordinary new/delete for DxvkResourceAllocation;
# all non-Android builds retain the original recycling pool.

# GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 30/07/2026 Two compounding staleness bugs
# found the hard way -- libdxvk_d3d9.so in this environment was last
# actually built 23/07, and every DXVK source patch applied since
# (including two meant to fix real device crashes, today) silently never
# made it into a single shipped APK despite every build reporting success:
#   1. Without BUILD_ALWAYS, ExternalProject_Add only ever runs
#      BUILD_COMMAND once and then trusts a stamp file forever, regardless
#      of source changes. Ninja's own incremental build inside
#      DXVK_BUILD_DIR is a no-op in well under a second when nothing
#      changed, so forcing this step to always run costs nothing and makes
#      ninja -- not a CMake stamp file -- the actual source of truth.
#   2. Even with (1) fixed, the add_custom_command below that copies the
#      built .so out of DXVK_BUILD_DIR only depended on the
#      dxvk_android_build *target* (an ordering-only dependency), not on
#      the .so *file* -- so Ninja never saw a reason to re-run the copy
#      when the file's content changed underneath it, and kept shipping
#      the stale copy. BUILD_BYPRODUCTS is what tells Ninja these paths
#      are real files this target produces, so downstream DEPENDS on the
#      file (not just the target) actually tracks freshness.
# meson links the DXVK libs against the in-tree libSDL3.so (from the generated
# sdl3.pc); make sure it exists before the ExternalProject's build step runs.
