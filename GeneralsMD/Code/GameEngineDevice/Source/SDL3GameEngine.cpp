// Mobile (iOS/Android) app lifecycle
//
// iOS and Android suspend the process when the app leaves the foreground. Any
// GPU work submitted around suspension stalls on drawable acquisition (MoltenVK
// waits out a timeout per present; Android tears down the ANativeWindow under
// the swapchain), which surfaces as multi-second input hangs right
// after resuming. SDL warns that lifecycle events can arrive outside the
// normal poll cycle, so they are captured in an event watcher that fires
// immediately on the delivering thread; the engine update loop checks the
// flag and skips simulation + rendering while backgrounded.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two independent reasons to halt the render/sim loop:
//  - BACKGROUNDED (home / switched away): the process is about to be suspended.
//  - INACTIVE (multitasking switcher open, Control Center, a notification
//    banner): iOS snapshots the window and owns the CAMetalLayer drawable during
//    this window — and crucially, opening the app switcher fires resign-active
//    WITHOUT a full background transition.
// Acquiring a Metal drawable during EITHER state fights iOS for the layer; across
// repeated suspend/switcher cycles MoltenVK is driven into an unrecoverable
// surface state and the app crashes (the reported "crashes after backgrounding /
// multitasking a few times"). Pause whenever either is set.

//
// GeneralsX @feature Android port 01/08/2026, rewritten 01/08/2026 twice
// Native touch control, with NO mouse hardware emulation anywhere:
//
// - Camera pan/zoom call TheTacticalView->userScrollBy()/userZoom()
//   directly (applyCameraPan()/applyCameraZoom()), driven by real per-frame
//   finger deltas. Nothing mouse-shaped is involved at all.
//
// - Selection, GUI clicks, right-click commands, and selection-box/slider
//   drags go straight onto TheMessageStream as the same MSG_RAW_MOUSE_*
//   GameMessages a real mouse would produce (pushMousePosition()/
//   pushMouseButton() below) -- but pushed directly from
//   real finger events, not synthesized as SDL_Event mouse structs fed
//   through SDL3Mouse's hardware-mouse pipeline. This is as close to "no
//   mouse system" as this engine's input architecture allows: selection
//   (SelectionXlat.cpp), GUI hover/hilite (WindowXlat.cpp), and the
//   multiplayer-sync message stream itself are all keyed on that exact
//   GameMessage vocabulary -- built in 2003 for a PC mouse, and there is no
//   bypassing that queue for ANY input device without rewriting those
//   systems (out of scope; this is the original engine's synchronization
//   mechanism for multiplayer/replays, not a design choice we get to
//   route around). What we DO get to remove is everything downstream of
//   that: no persisted cursor object, no OS mouse cursor, no hover-then-
//   click timing built for a physical mouse, no per-frame position
//   heartbeat -- SDL3Mouse::createStreamMessages() is a no-op on mobile
//   (see SDL3Mouse.cpp) specifically so nothing but real touch events ever
//   produces a mouse-shaped message. A GameMessage type being literally
//   named MSG_RAW_MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON_DOWN is a historical label, not mouse
//   emulation: no mouse is being pretended to exist, no cursor persists
//   between touches, and nothing here reads back "where the mouse is".
//
// Gestures, deliberately as few and as standard as an Android map/RTS app
// gets:
//   1 finger tap                       -> select / issue command (LMB click)
//   1 finger double-tap                -> select all of that unit's type on
//                                          screen (existing double-click handling)
//   1 finger drag, at ANY point, however long the finger sat still first ->
//                                          direct camera pan, immediately
//   1 finger drag released while still moving fast -> pan keeps coasting,
//                                          decelerating (momentum/inertia),
//                                          until it dies down or another
//                                          finger touches down
//   1 finger held still the whole time, released without ever moving ->
//                                          right-click (issue command)
//   2 fingers                          -> direct camera pan (centroid delta)
//                                          AND zoom (spread delta) together,
//                                          once per frame, unconditionally
//   2 fingers tapped together, both staying near where they landed ->
//                                          right-click (fast "cancel selection")
//
// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 01/08/2026, again Movement now ALWAYS wins
// over hold-duration, no matter when it happens. The previous cut fired the
// long-press right-click proactively the instant LONG_PRESS_MS elapsed
// (600ms) while the finger was still down, and any further drag from there
// upgraded to a selection-box drag instead of a pan -- so a completely
// ordinary drag that started with as little as half a second's hesitation
// (touch down, get oriented, THEN start moving -- unremarkable human
// timing) silently turned into "select a box of units" instead of "pan the
// camera", with no camera movement and no obvious visual cue why. Reported
// as "I drag with one finger like every other Android RTS and the camera
// just doesn't move, I'm stuck standing at my base". Fixed by resolving the
// long-press ONLY at release: if the finger crosses the pan dead zone at
// ANY time before lifting, however long it sat still first, it's a pan --
// long-press right-click only fires if the finger never moved at all,
// checked once, when it lifts. This removes single-finger press-and-hold-
// then-drag box-select entirely (it's what directly conflicted with "any
// drag pans") -- if box-select turns out to still be wanted, it needs its
// own separate gesture, not sharing single-finger drag with panning.
//
// GeneralsX @feature Android port 01/08/2026, again Two-finger tap-to-
// cancel is back: dropped in an earlier pass as "redundant with the
// single-finger long-press", but it's faster and more natural for
// "cancel/deselect" than reaching for a long-press, and was asked back
// explicitly. This does NOT reintroduce the old pan-vs-zoom classifier --
// TWOFINGER still always applies both pan and zoom every frame,
// unconditionally. This only ADDS a check at release: if neither finger
// moved more than TWO_FINGER_TAP_MAX_PX from where it landed, the whole
// gesture is also a tap -> fire right-click at the landing centroid.
//
// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 01/08/2026 Previous revisions tried to
// classify a two-finger gesture as EITHER pan OR zoom (a "one finger
// anchored, the other drags vertically" heuristic with a commit distance,
// a displacement ratio, and a co-directionality check) before applying
// anything -- built to fix an OLDER architecture where zoom was a discrete
// wheel-tick and any accidental pan alongside it was jarring. That
// architecture is gone: pan and zoom are now both continuous, real-pixel,
// 1:1 camera control, so feeding both signals every frame -- exactly the way
// a normal two-finger touch UI (map apps, browsers, Rusted Warfare) already
// works -- is simply correct. A little pan drift from two hands never moving
// in perfect lockstep during a pinch is imperceptible next to the zoom
// itself; the classifier was solving a problem this architecture doesn't
// have, and its heuristics were exactly why zoom worked "sometimes" --
// real symmetric two-hand pinches (both fingers moving, neither "anchored")
// routinely failed the ratio check and were misclassified as pan.
//
// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 01/08/2026 A prior revision added a fixed
// settle window (re-anchoring the pan reference point for the first 100ms
// after touch-down) to keep ordinary hold-still tremor from hijacking a tap
// into a pan. That timer could also silently eat an entire quick, deliberate
// flick if the whole gesture finished inside the window -- reported as
// "can't pan with my finger at all". Removed in favor of the simplest
// standard approach: a single dead-zone distance (TAP_DEAD_ZONE_PX) decides
// tap vs. drag, no timer involved, matching how every ordinary Android touch
// UI (not just this engine) already disambiguates the two.

// position around 1300-2000. A drag summing to 500+ screen pixels only
// moved the camera a few TENTHS of a world unit total: real motion, just

// Fixed by abandoning scrollBy()'s pixel-based formula entirely in favor of

// View::screenToTerrain(). Project the finger's previous and current screen

// sit on the ground", not guessing a pixel-to-world ratio) and adapts
// automatically to zoom level, camera angle, and screen resolution, unlike

	// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 02/08/2026 CONFIRMED root cause of the
	// "freezes unpredictably anywhere on the map, resumes later" reports
	// (device logs plus a 4-way parallel code audit, not a guess): View::
	// setPosition() -- what userSetPosition() calls -- is a bare `m_pos =
	// pos`. It never sets W3DView::m_recalcCamera, unlike the PC mouse-
	// drag path's scrollBy() (W3DView.cpp), which explicitly does. W3DView
	// ::update() only rebuilds the actual 3D camera transform (and, inside
	// that, only there invalidates screenToTerrain()'s per-pixel location
	// cache) when m_recalcCamera is true -- otherwise it can stay false for
	// an arbitrary number of frames (it only flips true incidentally, e.g.
	// when zoom or ground-height settling crosses their own thresholds,
	// which has nothing to do with where the camera is). While it's false,
	// our screenToTerrain() calls keep projecting against the SAME stale
	// transform/cache even though m_pos has already moved -- so
	// worldFrom-worldTo collapses toward zero and the pan visibly stops,
	// until something unrelated finally flips the flag and it lurches back
	// to life. Exactly matches "unpredictable in time, not tied to
	// location". Fixed by forcing the recalculation ourselves every time we
	// actually move the camera, via the same public forceRedraw() the
	// engine already exposes for this.
	//
	// GeneralsX @bugfix Android port 02/08/2026, reverted 02/08/2026 The same
	// audit also found that Generals' mission/skirmish scripting can call
	// View::setCameraLock() directly (ScriptActions.cpp, e.g. a "follow
	// this unit" cinematic trigger) to re-aim the camera at a locked object
	// every frame, and that doUserAction() never clears m_cameraLock, only
	// m_scriptedState. An earlier revision of this fix defensively cleared
	// any active camera lock here so touch dragging couldn't get stuck
	// fighting one -- but the PC mouse-drag path (userScrollBy(), same
	// doUserAction gating) has exactly the same non-clearing behavior, so a
	// real camera-lock cutscene ALREADY can't be broken out of with the
	// mouse either -- that's presumably intentional (a cutscene is supposed
	// to hold the camera). Forcibly releasing it only from touch would have
	// made touch behave inconsistently with mouse and defeated real
	// cutscene camera locks whenever one actually fires, not just the
	// hypothetical stray one this was guarding against -- never actually
	// confirmed to be the cause here. Reverted; forceRedraw() below is the
	// confirmed, sufficient fix.

// present well into a match, not just at session start, and predates the

// applyCameraZoom() directly from inside the FINGER_MOTION case, once per
// SDL touch event -- but pollSDL3Events() drains ALL queued SDL events in
// a single `while (SDL_PollEvent())` pass each frame, and a busier scene
// (more to render -> lower FPS -> touch events queue up faster than frames
// render) means MULTIPLE motion events for the same drag land in the same
// frame. View::screenToTerrain() casts against the 3D camera's actual
// transform (W3DView::m_3DCamera, updated once per frame by
// updateCameraTransform(), gated on m_recalcCamera) -- NOT against
// View::m_pos directly. userSetPosition() updates m_pos immediately, but
// the camera transform screenToTerrain() actually rays against stays stale
// until the NEXT frame's update() runs. So the first pan call in a frame
// projects correctly, but a second, third, etc. call for more motion
// events queued in that SAME frame would ray against the now-outdated
// (pre-this-frame's-moves) transform -- computing a wrong, often near-zero
// world delta, exactly like the camera "wasn't moving" for those events.
// Fixed by moving the actual camera-effect application out of the per-
// event handler and into this function, called ONCE per frame (see its
// call site in pollSDL3Events()) using whatever position/centroid/spread
